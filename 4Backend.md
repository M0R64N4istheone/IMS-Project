# Step 4: Building the Back-end with ASP.NET Core

This guide outlines the steps to build the back-end for an Inventory Management System using ASP.NET Core.

## Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Core Project

1. **Open Visual Studio**:
   - Launch Visual Studio and select “Create a new project”.

2. **Choose the Project Template**:
   - Select “ASP.NET Core Web API” as the project template. This template is specifically suited for creating RESTful APIs.

3. **Configure the Project**:
   - Name your project, choose a suitable location for it, and ensure you select the correct .NET Core version (preferably the latest stable release).
   - Make sure to check the options for enabling HTTPS and configure the project to use authentication if you want to integrate ASP.NET Core Identity.

4. **Create the Project**:
   - Click on "Create" to initialize your new ASP.NET Core Web API project.

## Step 2: Configure Entity Framework Core for Database Interaction

1. **Install Necessary Packages**:
   - Install the following NuGet packages in your project:
     - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`
     - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` (or another provider if using a different database)
     - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` for migrations.

2. **Define Your DbContext**:
   - As previously mentioned, create an `AppDbContext` class in your project which will manage the database operations.

3. **Configure DbContext in Startup.cs**:
   - Register your DbContext in the `Startup.cs` file to use the SQL Server with the connection string defined in `appsettings.json`.

4. **Add Migration and Update Database**:
   - Use the Entity Framework Core tools to add a migration and update the database accordingly.

## Step 3: Implement Authentication and Authorization Using Identity

1. **Install Identity Framework**:
   - Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore` package.

2. **Configure Identity**:
   - Extend your `AppDbContext` from `IdentityDbContext` to integrate ASP.NET Core Identity.
   - Update `Startup.cs` to include services for Identity and configure authentication middleware.

3. **Create Identity Models and Controllers**:
   - Define user roles and models if necessary.
   - Implement registration and login endpoints in an Authentication Controller.

## Step 4: Build APIs for Inventory Management System

1. **User Authentication (Login, Register)**:
   - Implement endpoints for users to register and login. Utilize ASP.NET Core Identity for managing users and handling password hashing.

2. **Inventory Management APIs (CRUD Operations)**:
   - Create controllers and actions for managing inventory items (GetItems, AddItem, UpdateItem, DeleteItem).

3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Implement endpoints for transactions that affect inventory (GetTransactions, AddTransaction).

4. **Reporting**:
   - Develop endpoints to generate reports on inventory status and transaction history (GetStockLevels, GenerateReports).

## Step 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Test APIs**:
   - Use tools like Postman or Swagger to test each endpoint. Ensure they perform as expected.

2. **Security and Validation**:
   - Add necessary validation for the data received in the APIs.
   - Ensure that the API has proper security measures in place, particularly for authentication and authorization.

## Final Steps

- **Refinement and Optimization**: After getting the basic functionality working, look into refining and optimizing the code and database queries.
- **Documentation**: Document the API endpoints with Swagger or any other API documentation tool.

By following these steps, you will establish a robust back-end for your Inventory Management System that supports user management, inventory control, transaction handling, and reporting functionalities.
