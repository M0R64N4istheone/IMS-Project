# Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
### Before coding, I set up the development environment properly:

1. Install Visual Studio: Since you are using C# and ASP.NET Core, Visual Studio is the ideal IDE. Download and install it from the official website.

2. Install Node.js: Necessary for managing packages needed in Angular. Download from Node.js official website.

3. Install Angular CLI: This tool helps you to create and manage Angular projects easily. Open a command prompt or terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
4. Choose and Install Database: Decide between SQL Server and PostgreSQL. For SQL Server, you can use the SQL Server Express Edition for a free version if cost is a concern. For PostgreSQL, download it from PostgreSQL official site.

5. Test the Setup: Create a simple test project in Angular and ASP.NET Core to ensure all parts of your development environment are working together seamlessly.
